      <description>&lt;p&gt;The poet&amp;rsquo;s relation to nature (pace those who view poetic creation as inspiration that comes from without) is informed, if not overdetermined by historical, social, and cultural contingencies. Both Woodsworth’s and Clare’s poems are marked by an intimacy that can only arise out of a partial identification with the environment they represent. Both poems also evoke feelings of nostalgia and portray the poet as an isolated individual. However, in “I wandered lonely as a cloud”, the poet’s isolation is not to be understood negatively, but is rather the precondition of his union with nature and communal gamboling; his nostalgia is the yearning for an immediate, unmediated experience of nature. The poet’s isolation in “Helpstone” is a form of alienation precipitated by “Accursed wealth” and relations of exploitation — the loss of a once sublime natural landscape is mourned (“Helpstone”, 127).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both “I wandered lonely as a cloud” and “Helpstone” express the interdependence of the constitutive elements of nature, this awareness has a thorough-going political dimension in Clare’s poem, (betraying the poet’s working-class origins) whereas in Woodsworth it retracts into bourgeois idealism. Clare’s “Genius” is encumbered by an economic imperative — “Where bustling Labour drives the hours long” — and one even gets the sense that Clare is referring to himself when he speaks of the “low” Genius’ inability to transcend or “rise” above his “vulgar” material conditions (“Helpstone”, 6). We can contrast this with Woodsworth’s Poet, who, removed from the constraints of labour, “floats on high o’er vales and hills” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 2).There are no moments of ecstasy in Clare’s poem, where one only encounters nature negatively— the village is “Unknown to grandeur” and the Genius is “Unknown nor heeded” (“Helpstone”, 3, 9). Since Labour violently dispossesses and subjugates the Genius, he is barred from any sort of literary recognition— “No minstrel boasting to advance thy name” (“Helpstone”, 4).  Unlike Woodsworth’s Poet, Clare’s identification with the environment does not result in “pleasure” and “glee” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud, 14, 23). Rather, it debases him since the domination of nature cannot be separated from the domination of man, as is evident from Clare’s personifying his village“—And thy mean village lifts its lowly head” (“Helpstone”, 2). The personification of the daffodils in Woodsworth’s poem, on the other hand— “Tossing their heads in a sprightly dance”—  elevates the Poet to a state where he “could not but be gay”(“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 12, 15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enclosure of land also results in a bifurcation— Clare can no longer straightforwardly identify with nature because it has been disfigured by “Accursed wealth” (“Helpstone”, 127). Even if such an identification were possible, it would not result in the blissful harmony experienced by Woodsworth’s Poet but rather a “useless Ignorance” that “slumbers life away”(“Helpstone”, 8. This bifurcation does not exist in “I wandered lonely as a cloud”, since the Poet’s identification with nature is not prohibited by a calamitous event such as the enclosure of the commons. While the failure of identification in Helpstone clearly demonstrates Clare’s disapprobation of the effects of a then-nascent capitalism, as well as his ecological consciousness, the Poet’s identification with nature in “I wandered lonely as a cloud” does not have these political overtones. Rather, it serves to fill his heart with pleasure upon experiencing union with nature— he has the privilege of experiencing solitude as “bliss” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 22). Reading Clare’s poem one can only imagine a monochromatic, barren landscape while Woodsworth’s Poet encounters “golden daffodils” and lively trees that are “Fluttering and dancing in the breeze” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 4, 6). There is thus an incredibly pronounced incongruity between a landscape that is teeming with life and one that is corpse-like, hostile to all life-forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader encounters in Clare’s poem a brief description of  “humble Helpstone” prior to this destruction, one which “fond memory clings” to (“Helpstone”, 1, 117).  It is clear that Clare’s memory of this veritable garden of Eden is a part of his identity, such that the physical enclosure of Helpstone is equally an enclosure of his soul. Consequently, this enclosure, that which alienates the labourer resulting in the irretrievable loss of “our labour and bread” (notice how, when referring to the destructive force that dispossesses the labourer Clare uses “thou”and “thine”, using “our” to emphasize the loss, not only of a physical environment, but an entire community) , produces another bifurcation, this time between past and present (“Helpstone”, 132). This discontinuity is so pronounced that there appears to be no possible way to contain the destructive force, or undo its effects by  returning to an idyllic past. It seems that the only thing to do is “bow down” and “clear a way” for the impersonal force ravaging the land (“Helpstone”, 134). Once again, this bifurcation does not exist in “I wandered lonely as a cloud”, where, in complete contrast to “Helpstone”, the joy of the Poet emerges precisely out of the continuity between past and present, as is evidenced by the Poet’s recollection, “ In vacant or in pensive mood/They flash upon that inward eye” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 21-22).  This continuity also allows for the possibility of narrative progress— the Poet is at first “lonely as a cloud”, but is then embraced by “jocund company” (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 1, 16). Conversely, in “Helpstone”, the physical enclosure of land terminates historical possibility and consigns the community to oblivion, to a “dark corner of obscurity”; there is no possibility of escape (“Helpstone”, 120).
While Clare confronts the impermanence of an environment untouched by economic forces, forced to reckon with his loneliness, Woodsworth revels in the infinitude of his cosmic vision of “stars that shine” in a “never-ending line” and is able to overcome his loneliness through union with nature (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”, 7,8).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review of Jantzen&#39;s &#39;William James and the varieties of postmodern religious experience&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In “William James and the varieties of postmodern religious experience”, Grace M. Jantzen problematizes an interpretation of James’ scholarly work—specifically as it relates to mystical experience, the reliability of such accounts, as well as the role that religion has in a (post)modern society— that is popular amongst analytic philosophers of religion. This interpretation stresses the importance of an objective stand-point through which reports of mystical experience can be evaluated. It would seem at first that this is the only way to move beyond the impasse James’ creates in his discussion of mysticism: if  moments of ecstasy, or mystical episodes that cannot be explained through recourse to phenomenal reality “have the right” to be binding on those individuals who experience them, but not on others, how can this tell us anything about the evidential value of these experiences? James’ use of the word “right” suggests that he is posing a question quid juris—  how is the person who has this experience entitled to it? If the mystic is entitled to it by virtue of experiencing it and the one who has not experienced it is entitled to reject it, then it would seem that (in the absence of an “objective” arbiter) it is entirely appropriate to consign mystical experience to a “private, subjective” sphere “without political consequence”— which is precisely what analytic philosophers of religion have done (Jantzen). Janzten does concede that James “leaves himself wide open to such interpretations”(Jantzen). However, thinkers can be read against themselves and this is what Jantzen sets out to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kantian stricture that analytic philosophers of religion apply to mystical experience in their reception of James work— by relegating mystical experience to the realm of noumena— can only be accomplished, argues Jantzen, if a third conclusion that James’ reaches concerning the authority of mystical states is ignored. In this conclusion, James mentions the possibility of “other orders of truth”, suggesting an ontological pluralism that would thoroughly disrupt the clean Kantian divide between phenomena and noumena (Jantzen). Indeed, Jantzen interprets this third conclusion as an example of James attempting to “escape the Kantian strictures on knowledge of the noumenal” (Jantzen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another consequence of this privileging of the purely “objective”, disinterested stand-point when investigating mystical or religious phenomena is that not enough attention is paid to said experiences&amp;rsquo; historical determinants, nor their political implications. These considerations are  absolutely indispensable for an analysis of the varieties of religion in post-modernity, according to Jantzen. Granted, James is not a historian of religion nor a political scientist— his focus,  quite clearly expressed at the beginning of the Gifford lectures, is psychology. Jantzen recognizes this fact, and argues that acknowledging these factors does not detract from James’ goals in the least. She notes that his analysis of religious doctrine is inextricably linked to his “philosophy of pragmatism” that emphasizes the “organic connection” between theory and practice, or “thought and conduct”(Jantzen).  James’ view is that the truth-value of a proposition is not only determined by its fidelity to the “facts” but also by its practicability. This attentiveness to “conduct” is sorely missing from the analysis of analytic philosophers of religion. The practitioners of rarefied forms of theology are passionately denounced by James— their God is a “metaphysical monster” and their theological system does not even approach the status of truth (Jantzen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytic philosophers of religion have been able to maintain their position by disavowing James’ Hegelianism. Hegel’s  theory of critical sociality precludes any privileging of a “stand-pointless” judgment; one cannot simply appeal to the imperative of observing things as they actually exist because Hegel’s project calls into question the “putative objectivity” of immediate sense experience (Jantzen). This crude empiricism fails because it does not have a concept, or theory of the whole. One cannot arrive at a conclusion about the value of something by dint of accumulating “facts”. The space of reason “arises within a shared linguistic and cultural system”(Jantzen).  As such, Jantzen argues that a study of mystical experience must take into account the socio-political landscape which is constitutive of them (Hindus have visions of Shiva, Chrisitans of Jesus, Muslims of Mohammad), and more broadly, the social construction of religion itself. Jantzen realizes that this is not a view that she can directly attribute to James himself, but nonetheless she argues it must lie at the core of any ethical pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to now evaluate Jantzen’s argument; strengths and certain weaknesses that I identified in the text. I think that Jantzen’s repudiation of the analytic position was well-argued, even though this meant, as mentioned earlier in the essay, reading James against himself. I think this is a good strategy because it brings to our attention what may have been dismissed as trivial in earlier readings of James’ work— the opposition between what is “essential” or “inessential” in the text is unsettled and called into question. Jantzen’s historicist approach also struck me as (although this can be attributed to the prejudices that I brought to my reading of the essay) altogether more convincing than the claim that there exists a position of pure objectivity from which one can dismiss personal experiences. However, that we are all informed by social and cultural biases, is a statement that I think hardly anybody would deny— and so I was left wondering if the arguments made by the analytic philosophers of religion moved beyond a Kantian denunciation of mystical experience. Indeed, throughout the essay, Jantzen refers to this group without ever mentioning its members or their specific arguments, and so I thought her argument operated at a somewhat general register. On the issue of generality or abstraction, I also think that Jantzen’s article would have benefited from more clarity concerning the usage of the word “postmodern”. A working definition is not offered in the article, and this left me with many questions. Jantzen does not seem to conceive of post-modernism along the same lines as Lyotard or Jameson, instead,  I thought that the definition of postmodernity operative in the essay viewed it as something inaugurated by political and social tumult, or perhaps characterized by multiple, contradictory religious prejudices that merely conceal structures of power.  I also found myself wondering if Jantzen was linking postmodernism with the impulse to historicize and remain attentive to ideological motivations— if such a link can be made, then are we to think of Hegel, Gadamer, and James as theorists of the postmodern? Are the analytic philosophers of religion merely offering encomiums to their own ideological biases, with nothing more to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between secularism and progressivism is something that Jantz comments on in the final pages of the essay. She argues that those who claim that a progressive politics can only emerge in the absence of religion are categorically wrong. However, I think that Jantz’s position is actually quite similar to the one she argues against. She writes, “rejection of religious experience by critical and progressive thinkers would simply abandon the field to those who conscript religious experience to devastating and reactionary ends” (Jantzen). Her statement categorizes those who have faith into two categories: the senseless reactionary and the “critical and progressive thinker”. Is this entirely different from the categorization that the secular progressive makes between the enlightened agnostic and the savage believer? Is this categorization also not an act of ideological mystification— completely ignoring the political determinants of radicalism? Jantzen has, throughout the essay, reminded us of the necessity to contextualize matters concerning religious experience, and even asks the Foucaldian question: “What political and cultural  technologies of power remain unchallenged if religious experience is construed as private unsituated intensity?” (Jantzen). If religious experience has socio-political determinants then surely the same thing can be said of religious extremism or fanaticism. Insofar as the spectral figure of the extremist is the Other of a secular, civilized society, then its role in producing this Other must also be investigated. I will end with a quote from a recent book that I read criticizing precisely this attitude, that is, pragmatist or Habermasian approaches to sociality, which I find  pertinent to my analysis: “Unthinkable within such a framework is that some might be excluded from or choose to opt out of the space of reasons: the space is bounded with all exits and entrances sealed. This precludes the possibility of radical dissensus and therefore of drastic change: the terms of rational agency are already determined such that alternative forms of practical rationality are ruled out from the outset as infeasible, ridiculous, violent, dangerous, undemocratic… or nonhuman” (Comay).&lt;/p&gt;
