      <description>&lt;p&gt;To argue that a good work of art ought to faithfully, that is, realistically depict a concrete referent in the world is to lose sight of the fact this “realism” itself is inextricably linked to an interpretative process— the artist taking, or understanding the world to be a certain way. To speak of the artist’s representation of a given landscape, for example, is to speak concurrently of that artist&amp;rsquo;s production of it. This production is not, indeed cannot be, value-neutral since it both informs and is informed by socio-historical determinations. This is especially the case for a work of art—or more generally an artistic genre— whose object is indeterminate due to its constitutive otherness. And yet, this unrepresentability, far from inducing silence, is precisely that which draws artists towards the object in hordes. The representation of the unrepresentable, in this case, is not an exercise in artistic inventiveness or creativity, but rather has an explicitly political purpose. This is less a penchant to represent than categorize— it thus attempts to quell the artists—that is, a given cultures— anxieties about the objects essential slipperiness, its refusal to be reconciled with that which already exists. This object, then, can be used — for the purposes of the artist—to adumbrate the social mores of that culture. One can, for example, look at casta paintings in order to better understand the racial prejudices and hierarchies that were prevalent in New Spain at the time of their production.  The depiction of social fixity in casta paintings, however, belied a society that, as R. Douglas Cope argues  in The Limits of Racial Domination, “retained  much…cultural autonomy” to such an extent, in fact, that Indigenous peoples employed “highly localized ethnic referents as late as the eighteenth century” (Cope, 4-5). These paintings, then, were not simply symbolizing already-existing racial categories so much as attempting to establish an epistemological grid through which fixed social identities could be ascribed to persons begotten of inter-ethnic or inter-racial marriages so that this cultural autonomy could be resisted. Casta paintings  assuage and calm the colonist by providing the illusion that everything is under control— nothing escapes the watchful eye of the artist. In this essay, I will discuss three casta paintings in light of their contemporary reception (as well as the prejudices that gave birth to them) in Thrall, allowing the aforementioned themes to guide my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trethewey deftly unsettles the narrative structure of various casta paintings through poetry that speaks an unwritten, that is, unrepresented history. She speaks in Taxonomy, for example,  through and of various persons depicted in casta paintings— “the morisca, the lobo, the chino,/ sambo, albino”  (Trethewey).  These are, to be sure, for the colonists, scientific categories; a veritable “[g]uidebook to the colony”, scrupulously kept, in which everyone has his place, as it were. There is no room for doubt or error in such a system. The poem continues and the reader is confronted with a line-break after the cataloging of various “mixed bloods”, perhaps expecting the list to continue into the next stanza, but, Trethewey instead writes “the no-te-entiendo—the/ I don’t understand you (Trethewey). One should not understand Trethewey here as simply refusing these categories. Her argument is far more radical. The “I don’t understand you” — this absolute unintelligibility— is immanent to the naming process itself. The emphasis should be placed on the “the” that precedes “I don’t understand you” since it is on the basis of this article that the reader knows that “I don’t understand you” is not an assertion but actually denotes a subject position.  “The I don’t understand you” in fact completes the list rather than straightforwardly rejects it. Is Trethewey, then, acquiescing to the colonists&amp;rsquo; categories? This is far from the case. It is precisely in completing the list that Trethewey reveals its constitutive, ineradicable incompleteness. As such, Trethewey herself does not aspire, in her poetry, to completeness. She recognizes that this seemingly hopeful counter-narrative is, at its base, a mangled appropriation of the colonist’s own methods. She thus rejects the simplifying hopefulness of counter-narrative by forwarding instead a critical register of hope. Her words, as Olga Dugan argues in Renegade Poetics, Southscapes, and the Poetry of History in Natasha Trethewey’s Thrall”,  “prick and wound without necessarily coming together as an orderly and healing whole” (Dugan, 314).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonist might dream of wholeness, a perfect system, but will always be at least one category shy of his dream, since this category is simultaneously the system&amp;rsquo;s condition of possibility and impossibility. It is its condition of possibility insofar that it allows the colonist to begin the naming process, to metabolize difference. But it is also its condition of impossibility since it never allows the colonist to finish this process. If this system has a telos, it is one that is essentially comic: the final category reached— “the I don’t understand you” — reveals the ridiculousness of assuming that one might ever reach a final category. She thus restores a sort of revolutionary dignity to the colonized: they are, in such a system, an Other awaiting metabolization, but they also herald the news that this metabolization is to be eternally deferred. Colonial society can know no (epistemological) peace in the face of its Other, which it itself posits.  It is in this sense that Trethewey rejects the “catalog of mixed bloods” and critically approaches casta paintings (Trethewey). She rehabilitates not the paintings themselves but the subjects depicted therein. Indeed, one could argue, as Joseph Millichap does in ““Love and Knowledge”: Daughters and Fathers in Natasha Trethewey’s Thrall” that “Thrall becomes Trethewey’s own book of castas” (Millichap, 195).  But this rehabilitation, as mentioned above, is carried out in an entirely negative and critical way: she does not offer  “putatively “positive” images as a counter to racist taxonomy. Instead, she exposes the process of “seeing blackness” as the central problem” (Jones, 408).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the painting “From Cambujo and Mulatta, an Albarazo is Born” and the manner in which Blackness is depicted in it— the family is shown to be devoid of all dignity, in a state of desperate penury. Casta paintings often depict a domestic setting— and, provided that a Spanish individual is present in the painting, this setting is quite lavish. The family in this painting however— composed of a Cambujo, Mulatta, and an Albarazo— are permanently homeless. The absence of the Spanish, that is, of whiteness, is the absence of a domestic space. The colonized can only occupy the margins of society, eternally wandering. To wander these physical margins is to also occupy the outskirts of culture itself: the colonized have no time for creative pursuits, they are too busy surviving. Notice, for example, the (presumably Spanish) couple playing guitar in the background of the painting. This, of course, is to be contrasted with the couple in the foreground who are in tattered, worn clothes. Even their child, with outstretched arms, hesitates to join them— such is, according to this painting, the fate of a union between two people of  darker complexion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this fate radically altered if one of the members of the family were Spanish? This is a question answered by the painting “From Spanish and Black, Mulatta is Born”. Depicted in this painting is violent marital conflict. The Spanish man&amp;rsquo;s Black wife is grabbing him by the locks of his hairs and wields a kitchen utensil in her other hand in order to strike him. The man is visibly shocked and attempts to distance himself from his wife. Their daughter is in distress and begs for her mother to calm down. This painting, very clearly, serves as a warning. It admonishes the Spanish man who could be so foolish as to marry a Black woman, essentially proclaiming, “if you are to go down this path, expect nothing less!”. The in-born savage nature of the mother— who knows nothing but strife— is demonstrated to be hostile to a domestic, idyllic life. Both of these paintings are thus very similar since they condemn most harshly those marriages that are deemed undesirable. In the first painting, the possibility of such a couple ever entering civil society is immediately foreclosed. In the second, the consequences of forcing such an entry is demonstrated in the form of a discordant marriage— one cannot expect, so the painting tells us, a harmonious union between a savage and an individual endowed with a pure soul. The colonized subjects, in both paintings, are captives of the colonial imagination, their inferiority presented as though it were a natural fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, does Trethewey begin the rehabilitative process? In On Captivity, Trethewey reveals that far from being natural, this order is one that is completely contingent and violently enforced. She does this by describing a historical event in which the roles are reversed, so to speak. The “savage” is now the master, whereas the former masters are captives whose bodies are “rendered/plain as the natives” (Trethewey). Is it possible to speak of the natural inferiority, the cowardice, of the settlers in this scenario? Or have they simply found themselves— through no fault of their own— in unfavorable circumstances? Trethewey does not spend any time spewing vitriol or exacting poetic revenge. Nor does she sympathize with the captive settlers. She only observes the irony of their situation. If, in “From Cambujo and Mulatta, an Albarazo is Born”, the family is shown to wear the simplest of clothes, it is in On Captivity that the settlers find themselves in a far more scandalous position— utter nakedness. Was it not in a similar state of nakedness that the settlers first encountered the Natives? Was this lack of propriety not taken as the greatest offense to European sensibilities? Did it not require that the European bring the Native to knowledge of the truth of the Bible? One can read On Captivity—essentially a meditation about the fortuitous swapping of roles— as a speculative response to these questions. Now it is the all-mighty Europeans— not the Native— who, “Naked as newborns” are “brought to knowledge” (Trethewey). And what is the settlers only recourse in such a situation? He has no choice but to cover himself with “the torn leaves of Genesis” (Trethewey). Those hallowed pages that spurred the European on in his effort to civilize the wretched now hang from his naked body. He finds himself in a state that he sought to purge from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one might argue, to the painting “From Spanish and Mestiza, Castiza is Born” an almost redemptive quality. It is not a representation of poverty nor marital conflict. Rather, one observes an elegantly clothed couple. The Spanish husband points beyond, carrying a rifle on his shoulder. Here we have a portrait of the vigorous, restless conquistador who ventures into the unknown. The wife bows her head obligingly, holding her daughter to her breast. This painting, one might continue, finally represents Indigeneity in a good light. Trethewey criticizes this position in the poem Taxonomy. That the Spanish admit someone of Indigenous ancestry into their ranks does not speak to their emancipatory ambitions. The Mestiza is only tolerated because she has Spanish blood, and can be used for the purposes of re-introducing purity back into a bloodline: “from a Spaniard and an Indian/a mestizo;/ from a mestizo and a Spaniard,/ a castizo;/ from a castizo and a Spaniard,/ a Spaniard” (Trethewey). The mestiza and her daughter, the castiza, are instrumentalized for this purpose. If she is tolerated it is only because she bears this potential, and must be coaxed into actualizing it— she is purity twice removed. She is tolerated insofar as she promises her own negation. She gives birth not to someone like herself, but someone who heralds this negation, who is one step closer to attaining the wholeness of purity. She gives birth, then, so that there is no longer anyone like her. She is caught in a system that is “unethical… due to a propensity to exert power over the Other, defining and thus reducing the Other to what she is not, annihilating difference” (Valenzuela-Mendoza, 338). It is this absence of a proper ethical relation (in the Levinasian sense), as Valenzuela-Mendoza argues, that results in the instrumentalization of the mestiza mother, her being treated as an object. The castiza, too, is in the most precarious of situations.  There is, for her, no “[anxious balance] between love and knowledge”, since the self-annihilating knowledge she bears does not “[incline] towards love” — she can never know maternal love because she is required to “turn toward the father… to the promise of blood… to purity” which is only “one generation away” (Millichamp, 196; Trethewey).  In doing so, she slips from “her mother’s careful grip” (Trethewey).  This painting, far from representing Indigeneity in a good light, reproduces “the mind of the colony” (Trethewey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casta paintings, then, were in a sense, a guide on how to navigate unprecedented difference in a community— a propaedeutic for discerning “purity” amidst innumerable so-called impure persons. To read them differently, to look for signs in them of an emancipatory logic, is something that Trethewey, in Thrall, sternly warns against. One must instead turn to Indigenous art if one searches for a site of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;[The] uncanny foreignness is within us: we are our own foreigners, we are divided&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;                    — Julia Kristeva, Strangers to Ourselves
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the crucial insights of psychoanalysis is that the dead, or the forgotten past, have a claim on us— their  presence can often be felt more viscerally than the undead—that which is alive and presents itself to us directly in physical and psychical reality.  This is an observation unnerving as it is profound, as it unsettles, indeed disfigures, the supposedly rationalistic ethos constitutive of modernity. Psychoanalytic theory is especially well-suited in dealing with the spectral since its very condition of possibility is grounded in its oblique confrontation with that which otherwise might be dismissed as mere fantasy. Moreover, the fundamental theoretical object of psychoanalysis— the unconscious— possesses this spectral, phantom-like quality.  In my essay, I will be working with the definition of phantom offered by Nicolas Abraham in “Notes on the Phantom” — precisely because he locates the origin of the phantom within the unconscious— in which he theorizes that “the phantom is a formation of the unconscious that has never been conscious… it works like a ventriloquist, like a stranger within the subject’s own mental topography” (Abraham 290).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is not the phantom, then, the uncanny par excellence? The phantom is representative of the excesses of subjectivity, as Dimitris Vardoulakis argues, it “undoes any explication of subjectivity in terms of sharp demarcations” (Vardoulakis 101). It’s emergence relies on some form of familial transmission, it is informed by a “psycho-genetic heritage”, to use Durban’s terminology, yet it is not reducible to this transmission and thus evades ones straight-forward identification with it— one cannot make sense of it through reference to an established “system of relationships” since its primary task is to undo, render unintelligible systems of meaning. I will attend specifically to the role a phantom might have in the formation of the subjective constitution of colonized peoples, or, more specifically, the relationship between the unconscious and (colonial) subjectivity. At the heart of any discussion of the subjectivity of the oppressed is the possibility of its determinate negation, that is, the emancipation of the colonized subject from the discursive framework which assigns to him this subject position in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only a matter of determining the best political action to achieve this emancipation, but also necessitates a theory, or concept of the subject since every political project presupposes one. An urgent question that must be asked, then, is: what is the defining characteristic of colonial subjectivity? One may argue that it possesses a positive, substantial quality—  Blackness, for example, can be imagined as a concrete category with strict demarcations. The idea of emancipation that follows from this interpretation of subjectivity is one that privileges recognition; the phenomenon of racism will disappear once Black people are recognized not as the obscene Other of European civilization, but as equal to white people. However, I will argue that Blackness should instead be conceptualized as the site of a radical negativity, what Fanon calls the “zone of non-being” —  an interpretation that emphasizes the spectral, phantom-like quality of subjectivity. This understanding of the colonial subject does not lead to an impotent political project, but is rather guided by the insight that the desire for recognition from the Master can only arise within the context of colonial relations. To actualize the paradigmatic shift from the “world of being” to the “world of meaning” that Fanon outlines, I will argue that the colonial subject must work through the contradictions of the socio-symbolic order of colonialism (Fanon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alain Badiou, praising Freud’s discovery of the fundamental structure of desire in his book The Century, writes, “By 1918, as we can see, Freud had already clearly identified a ploy that has been operative ever since, which consists in preferring the articulation of desire and its object back to a meaning that is pre-constituted in culture, mythology, or religion… this is the hermeneutic ploy, and Freud immediately saw it as an insidious negation of his discovery” (Badiou 115). Badiou touches on an issue that is of central importance to my paper— he clearly articulates the impasse, the “hermeneutic ploy” that one encounters when speaking of something as elusive as desire. In short, the question that Badiou poses, which had been asked by Freud before him is: how can one even begin to speak of something that resists symbolization? The phantom can be thought of as a concept that is conjured precisely in order to grasp this question. And while Badiou here is referring to Freud’s explication of sexual desire, the same question can be asked of the desire to know, or represent, a racialized Other (in this case it is the racialized Other that resists symbolization).  One should not understand Abraham’s use of the word “phantom”, however, as an effort to symbolize the unsymbolizable; he does not attempt to prematurely overcome this impasse or pretend to untangle the psychoanalytic knot.  The phantom exists as a “metapsychological fact” not because it can be identified with an object in phenomenal experience, nor even the loss or lack of this object; instead,  it is founded on a lack of lack, the break-down of symbolic reality as such. (Abraham 171). The phantom exists only as the “gaps” — the unsymbolizable par excellence— “left within us by the secrets of others” (Abraham 171).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phantom, then, is capable of  denaturalizing subjectivity because it reveals these gaps; it disrupts the fantasy of an identity prior to a socially specific signifying process. This is a fantasy that is foundational to the racist, colonial socio-symbolic order since whiteness is conceived as a master-signifier within it. Durban’s discussion of “shadows, ghosts, and chimaeras” is similar to Abraham’s “phantom” in that it too problematizes this idea of  subjectivity as a pre-given, natural category. Recounting a patient&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary psychic development, Durban writes, “At first there was a white hole… White was in white…Then I was in the black hole, screaming and screaming but no one heard” (Durban). One may be quick to dismiss this account as an instantiation of psychic pathology, but what it actually does is provide a model for subjective development. Subjectivation is a violent process; trauma is constitutive of subjectivity. Durban argues that one confronts trauma retroactively. This confrontation takes the form of appropriating an inapprobiable event, i.e., what is commonly referred to as “making sense” of one&amp;rsquo;s trauma. There is always an excess that cannot be contained, however, and so trauma, or the “phantom” carries out its return, when words, stripped of their “libidinal grounding” are uttered (Abraham 174). This should not be understood in the sense that the mere utterance of these words has a magical effect on those who hear it. Language, or words, here denotes not only verbal speech but rather “any signifying system that is based upon differential relations” (Ghosh 1). Recall Lacan in Seminar XX: “the notion of discourse should be taken as a social link (lien social), founded on language, and thus seems not unrelated to what is specified in linguistics as grammar” (Lacan 17). What Abraham calls “phantasmogenic words” have not only a communicative purpose, but also an impact on the chain of signification (Abraham 176). It is also by understanding language in this way that we can arrive at an adequate concept of “haunting”; this obstinate, persistent presence of the phantom and its generational transmission. Subjective traumas of the past, the destruction of a collective identity vis a vis a devastating event, can indeed influence, even determine, the subjective constitution of later generations. In Moses and Monotheism for example, Freud grapples with a question of great existential significance— what is it that makes the Jewish people so resilient? Moses, as the archetypal “father-leader” (killed only to come back to haunt his assailants) is elevated to the dignity of the Thing—that unsymbolizable force that nonetheless ties Jewish identity together—whether the Jews are consciously aware of it or not (Frosh 248).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the subjective repercussions of this rupture, the emergence of the phantom? The existence of the phantom impels us to think of subjectivity as, paradoxically, that which is removed from itself and is never self-identical to itself. Abraham writes, “The phantom is summoned therefore, at the opportune moment, when it is recognized that a gap was transmitted to the subject with the result of barring him or her from the specific introjections he or she would seek at present” (Abraham 174). Of crucial importance here is the “barring” of the subject, yet another reference to Lacan, who represents the barred subject with the matheme “$”. Only when we have this concept of the barred subject can we explicate the relationship between subjectivity and the unconscious, or the phantom which is a formation of the unconscious. Joan Copjec, in her essay “Vampire, Breast-Feeding, and Anxiety,  writes “&amp;hellip; it is necessary to say that the real is absented, to declare its impossibility…[t]he real that is to be negated cannot be represented by a signifier, since the real is, by definition, that which has no adequate signifier” (Copjec 55). Copjec’s insight is crucial for understanding Fanon&amp;rsquo;s suspicion of the existence of a truly  authentic and concrete Black identity. Moreover, Copjec’s analysis of the relationship between subjectivity and the unconscious can also be applied to the relationship between subjectivity and the socio- symbolic order— if Copjec is arguing that the subject differs from itself, then the very same thing can be said of the socio-symbolic order.  Indeed, Fanon’s critical intervention is directed precisely at this relationship. He does not interpret Blackness as merely an Imaginary (in the sense Lacan uses the word) identity grounded in a coherent Symbolic discourse, but rather, Blackness for Fanon represents the “Real of the colony” —  it is that which the colonial socio-symbolic order must safeguard itself from, the “phantom trace which haunts the Symbolic but cannot be adequately approximated by the function of the signifier” (Thakur 631). It is for this reason that Fanon writes that the colonial subject traverses “the crossroads between Nothingness [le Néant] and Infinity [l’Infini]”; the Black subject specifically is the personification of non-being (Fanon 119; Thakur 641). For Fanon, this “non-negated negativity” arises principally from the impossible situation Black people find themselves in: they can either futilely attempt to “become white”  or try to reconnect to an imagined, mythic past (Thakur 612).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Copjec, when discussing the real, uses the words “say” and “declare”, essentially tethering it to the domain of language. This might appear counter-intuitive, perhaps even counterproductive— is not the whole aim of Fanon’s critical project to step outside the colonial socio-symbolic order and disavow its language? And how can we speak of the real if we can only pass over it in silence?  Herein lies the importance of immanent critique: the truly radical act is not to reject in toto colonial language, but rather work through its contradictions and limitations. This is particularly important since one cannot merely strip away one&amp;rsquo;s identity, or literally “step outside” the world that defines one&amp;rsquo;s social being. Fanon himself assigns to language a great value— the very first chapter of  Black Skin, White Masks starts with the following statement:  “I ascribe a basic importance to the phenomenon of language. That is why I find it necessary to begin with this subject, which should provide us with one of the elements in the colored man&amp;rsquo;s comprehension of the dimension of the other” (Fanon 17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What might this immanent critique look like and can the concept of the phantom be invoked when constructing an emancipatory political project? Homi Bhabha, in his influential essay “Of Mimicry and Man: The Ambivalence of Colonial Discourse” argues that the zone of nonbeing theorized by Fanon allows us to rethink identity and its sedimentation— identity no longer needs as its foundation the transcendent, self-identical Idea but is rather developed in an immanent and differential field. If repetition in the colonial socio-symbolic order serves the purpose of sedimenting subjectivity (I act a certain way because I saw my parents doing the same thing) and reproducing social hierarchies; in the zone of non-being, repetition produces phantoms. While for Fanon, imitating or mimicking the colonizer is ultimately unproductive— “when I tried to claim my negritude intellectual as a concept, they snaatched it away from me” — Bhabha argues that mimicry is marked by a carnivalesque quality that parodies the dominant colonial socio-symbolic order; it is a “mode of representation, that marginalizes the monumentality of history, quite simply mocks its power to be a model, that power which supposedly makes it imitable” (Fanon 111; Bhabha 128). Bhabha argues that mimicry necessarily produces excess and slippage, or in other words, a phantom. Once the phantom emerges, it perpetuates this cycle of repetition, as Abraham reminds us, “[f]inally it gives rise to endless repetition and, more often than not eludes rationalization” (Abraham 175). The phantom produced by mimicry refuses colonial representation and concurrently haunts the colonizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the phantom also haunts the colonized— the subject bears the weight of historical injustices on her shoulders. How does one go about exorcizing these phantoms of which we cannot speak? Abraham is almost silent on this matter, ending the essay with the remark that one ought to place “the effects of the phantom in the social realm” (Abraham). It seems as though we have come full circle, running up against the same impasse that we had attempted to overcome: once again, the colonial subject is forced to confront, perhaps even stay within the colonial socio-symbolic order because, as Copjec argues, the subject is the “failure that sustains the symbolic order” (Copjec 54).  The subject is this failure precisely because she can never apprehend the real. How can the symbolic order accommodate this excess, its disavowed phantoms? My essay has largely been a meditation on this question but still (unsurprisingly) one cannot even hope for a definitive answer. But, this, of course, is not a cause for despair. It is precisely the constitutive incapacity of the symbolic order to accommodate all its referents that creates a  “constant gradient of desire, a perpetual reaching out for the pure reality behind representation” (Kirshner).  The subject will ultimately search in vain for this “pure” reality— as Hegel reminds us, there is nothing behind the curtain of appearance except for what we put there.&lt;/p&gt;
