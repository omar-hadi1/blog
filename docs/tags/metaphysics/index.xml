      <description>&lt;p&gt;To argue that a good work of art ought to faithfully, that is, realistically depict a concrete referent in the world is to lose sight of the fact this “realism” itself is inextricably linked to an interpretative process— the artist taking, or understanding the world to be a certain way. To speak of the artist’s representation of a given landscape, for example, is to speak concurrently of that artist&amp;rsquo;s production of it. This production is not, indeed cannot be, value-neutral since it both informs and is informed by socio-historical determinations. This is especially the case for a work of art—or more generally an artistic genre— whose object is indeterminate due to its constitutive otherness. And yet, this unrepresentability, far from inducing silence, is precisely that which draws artists towards the object in hordes. The representation of the unrepresentable, in this case, is not an exercise in artistic inventiveness or creativity, but rather has an explicitly political purpose. This is less a penchant to represent than categorize— it thus attempts to quell the artists—that is, a given cultures— anxieties about the objects essential slipperiness, its refusal to be reconciled with that which already exists. This object, then, can be used — for the purposes of the artist—to adumbrate the social mores of that culture. One can, for example, look at casta paintings in order to better understand the racial prejudices and hierarchies that were prevalent in New Spain at the time of their production.  The depiction of social fixity in casta paintings, however, belied a society that, as R. Douglas Cope argues  in The Limits of Racial Domination, “retained  much…cultural autonomy” to such an extent, in fact, that Indigenous peoples employed “highly localized ethnic referents as late as the eighteenth century” (Cope, 4-5). These paintings, then, were not simply symbolizing already-existing racial categories so much as attempting to establish an epistemological grid through which fixed social identities could be ascribed to persons begotten of inter-ethnic or inter-racial marriages so that this cultural autonomy could be resisted. Casta paintings  assuage and calm the colonist by providing the illusion that everything is under control— nothing escapes the watchful eye of the artist. In this essay, I will discuss three casta paintings in light of their contemporary reception (as well as the prejudices that gave birth to them) in Thrall, allowing the aforementioned themes to guide my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trethewey deftly unsettles the narrative structure of various casta paintings through poetry that speaks an unwritten, that is, unrepresented history. She speaks in Taxonomy, for example,  through and of various persons depicted in casta paintings— “the morisca, the lobo, the chino,/ sambo, albino”  (Trethewey).  These are, to be sure, for the colonists, scientific categories; a veritable “[g]uidebook to the colony”, scrupulously kept, in which everyone has his place, as it were. There is no room for doubt or error in such a system. The poem continues and the reader is confronted with a line-break after the cataloging of various “mixed bloods”, perhaps expecting the list to continue into the next stanza, but, Trethewey instead writes “the no-te-entiendo—the/ I don’t understand you (Trethewey). One should not understand Trethewey here as simply refusing these categories. Her argument is far more radical. The “I don’t understand you” — this absolute unintelligibility— is immanent to the naming process itself. The emphasis should be placed on the “the” that precedes “I don’t understand you” since it is on the basis of this article that the reader knows that “I don’t understand you” is not an assertion but actually denotes a subject position.  “The I don’t understand you” in fact completes the list rather than straightforwardly rejects it. Is Trethewey, then, acquiescing to the colonists&amp;rsquo; categories? This is far from the case. It is precisely in completing the list that Trethewey reveals its constitutive, ineradicable incompleteness. As such, Trethewey herself does not aspire, in her poetry, to completeness. She recognizes that this seemingly hopeful counter-narrative is, at its base, a mangled appropriation of the colonist’s own methods. She thus rejects the simplifying hopefulness of counter-narrative by forwarding instead a critical register of hope. Her words, as Olga Dugan argues in Renegade Poetics, Southscapes, and the Poetry of History in Natasha Trethewey’s Thrall”,  “prick and wound without necessarily coming together as an orderly and healing whole” (Dugan, 314).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colonist might dream of wholeness, a perfect system, but will always be at least one category shy of his dream, since this category is simultaneously the system&amp;rsquo;s condition of possibility and impossibility. It is its condition of possibility insofar that it allows the colonist to begin the naming process, to metabolize difference. But it is also its condition of impossibility since it never allows the colonist to finish this process. If this system has a telos, it is one that is essentially comic: the final category reached— “the I don’t understand you” — reveals the ridiculousness of assuming that one might ever reach a final category. She thus restores a sort of revolutionary dignity to the colonized: they are, in such a system, an Other awaiting metabolization, but they also herald the news that this metabolization is to be eternally deferred. Colonial society can know no (epistemological) peace in the face of its Other, which it itself posits.  It is in this sense that Trethewey rejects the “catalog of mixed bloods” and critically approaches casta paintings (Trethewey). She rehabilitates not the paintings themselves but the subjects depicted therein. Indeed, one could argue, as Joseph Millichap does in ““Love and Knowledge”: Daughters and Fathers in Natasha Trethewey’s Thrall” that “Thrall becomes Trethewey’s own book of castas” (Millichap, 195).  But this rehabilitation, as mentioned above, is carried out in an entirely negative and critical way: she does not offer  “putatively “positive” images as a counter to racist taxonomy. Instead, she exposes the process of “seeing blackness” as the central problem” (Jones, 408).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, the painting “From Cambujo and Mulatta, an Albarazo is Born” and the manner in which Blackness is depicted in it— the family is shown to be devoid of all dignity, in a state of desperate penury. Casta paintings often depict a domestic setting— and, provided that a Spanish individual is present in the painting, this setting is quite lavish. The family in this painting however— composed of a Cambujo, Mulatta, and an Albarazo— are permanently homeless. The absence of the Spanish, that is, of whiteness, is the absence of a domestic space. The colonized can only occupy the margins of society, eternally wandering. To wander these physical margins is to also occupy the outskirts of culture itself: the colonized have no time for creative pursuits, they are too busy surviving. Notice, for example, the (presumably Spanish) couple playing guitar in the background of the painting. This, of course, is to be contrasted with the couple in the foreground who are in tattered, worn clothes. Even their child, with outstretched arms, hesitates to join them— such is, according to this painting, the fate of a union between two people of  darker complexion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this fate radically altered if one of the members of the family were Spanish? This is a question answered by the painting “From Spanish and Black, Mulatta is Born”. Depicted in this painting is violent marital conflict. The Spanish man&amp;rsquo;s Black wife is grabbing him by the locks of his hairs and wields a kitchen utensil in her other hand in order to strike him. The man is visibly shocked and attempts to distance himself from his wife. Their daughter is in distress and begs for her mother to calm down. This painting, very clearly, serves as a warning. It admonishes the Spanish man who could be so foolish as to marry a Black woman, essentially proclaiming, “if you are to go down this path, expect nothing less!”. The in-born savage nature of the mother— who knows nothing but strife— is demonstrated to be hostile to a domestic, idyllic life. Both of these paintings are thus very similar since they condemn most harshly those marriages that are deemed undesirable. In the first painting, the possibility of such a couple ever entering civil society is immediately foreclosed. In the second, the consequences of forcing such an entry is demonstrated in the form of a discordant marriage— one cannot expect, so the painting tells us, a harmonious union between a savage and an individual endowed with a pure soul. The colonized subjects, in both paintings, are captives of the colonial imagination, their inferiority presented as though it were a natural fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How, then, does Trethewey begin the rehabilitative process? In On Captivity, Trethewey reveals that far from being natural, this order is one that is completely contingent and violently enforced. She does this by describing a historical event in which the roles are reversed, so to speak. The “savage” is now the master, whereas the former masters are captives whose bodies are “rendered/plain as the natives” (Trethewey). Is it possible to speak of the natural inferiority, the cowardice, of the settlers in this scenario? Or have they simply found themselves— through no fault of their own— in unfavorable circumstances? Trethewey does not spend any time spewing vitriol or exacting poetic revenge. Nor does she sympathize with the captive settlers. She only observes the irony of their situation. If, in “From Cambujo and Mulatta, an Albarazo is Born”, the family is shown to wear the simplest of clothes, it is in On Captivity that the settlers find themselves in a far more scandalous position— utter nakedness. Was it not in a similar state of nakedness that the settlers first encountered the Natives? Was this lack of propriety not taken as the greatest offense to European sensibilities? Did it not require that the European bring the Native to knowledge of the truth of the Bible? One can read On Captivity—essentially a meditation about the fortuitous swapping of roles— as a speculative response to these questions. Now it is the all-mighty Europeans— not the Native— who, “Naked as newborns” are “brought to knowledge” (Trethewey). And what is the settlers only recourse in such a situation? He has no choice but to cover himself with “the torn leaves of Genesis” (Trethewey). Those hallowed pages that spurred the European on in his effort to civilize the wretched now hang from his naked body. He finds himself in a state that he sought to purge from the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, however, one might argue, to the painting “From Spanish and Mestiza, Castiza is Born” an almost redemptive quality. It is not a representation of poverty nor marital conflict. Rather, one observes an elegantly clothed couple. The Spanish husband points beyond, carrying a rifle on his shoulder. Here we have a portrait of the vigorous, restless conquistador who ventures into the unknown. The wife bows her head obligingly, holding her daughter to her breast. This painting, one might continue, finally represents Indigeneity in a good light. Trethewey criticizes this position in the poem Taxonomy. That the Spanish admit someone of Indigenous ancestry into their ranks does not speak to their emancipatory ambitions. The Mestiza is only tolerated because she has Spanish blood, and can be used for the purposes of re-introducing purity back into a bloodline: “from a Spaniard and an Indian/a mestizo;/ from a mestizo and a Spaniard,/ a castizo;/ from a castizo and a Spaniard,/ a Spaniard” (Trethewey). The mestiza and her daughter, the castiza, are instrumentalized for this purpose. If she is tolerated it is only because she bears this potential, and must be coaxed into actualizing it— she is purity twice removed. She is tolerated insofar as she promises her own negation. She gives birth not to someone like herself, but someone who heralds this negation, who is one step closer to attaining the wholeness of purity. She gives birth, then, so that there is no longer anyone like her. She is caught in a system that is “unethical… due to a propensity to exert power over the Other, defining and thus reducing the Other to what she is not, annihilating difference” (Valenzuela-Mendoza, 338). It is this absence of a proper ethical relation (in the Levinasian sense), as Valenzuela-Mendoza argues, that results in the instrumentalization of the mestiza mother, her being treated as an object. The castiza, too, is in the most precarious of situations.  There is, for her, no “[anxious balance] between love and knowledge”, since the self-annihilating knowledge she bears does not “[incline] towards love” — she can never know maternal love because she is required to “turn toward the father… to the promise of blood… to purity” which is only “one generation away” (Millichamp, 196; Trethewey).  In doing so, she slips from “her mother’s careful grip” (Trethewey).  This painting, far from representing Indigeneity in a good light, reproduces “the mind of the colony” (Trethewey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casta paintings, then, were in a sense, a guide on how to navigate unprecedented difference in a community— a propaedeutic for discerning “purity” amidst innumerable so-called impure persons. To read them differently, to look for signs in them of an emancipatory logic, is something that Trethewey, in Thrall, sternly warns against. One must instead turn to Indigenous art if one searches for a site of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes on the Concept of Totality in Heidegger</title>
      <link>/posts/heidegger/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The concepts of  “end” and “totality”  (as well as the relationship that figures between the two) are central to Heidegger’s analysis of death. And yet he wants to disabuse us (as he is wont to do) of thinking about these concepts in a manner that would be altogether unsuitable for his analysis. Indeed, to understand Dasein’s “end” qua perishing, or disappearance, is to lose sight of death, since death, for Heidegger, much like the analytic of Dasein, is to be understood ontologically; that is, as an ontological possibility. Now, it is true that Heidegger acknowledges that his ontological characterization of death “signifies nothing, so long as a corresponding ontical potentiality-for-Being has not been demonstrated in Dasein itself” (Heidegger 1962, 311). As such, I will, in this paper, investigate both the existential and existentiell dimensions of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidegger begins his analysis of death with a detailed investigation of its character as that which is “outstanding”. To be sure, this is not a quality unique to death, since all the  possibilities of Dasein must be similarly outstanding. The crucial difference between death and other possibilities is that death is the only non-actualizable possibility of Dasein— it is that which “is the possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all (Heidegger 1962, 307). But if death is a phenomenon that is ontologically constitutive of Dasein, we cannot treat it as though it were yet another “event” in the course of Dasein’s life, nor is understanding death qua the biological cessation of life appropriate for Heidegger’s purposes. Death, rather, is Dasein’s end. However, Dasein does not simply “arrive” at this end, since in arriving at its end Dasein no longer is. This is also why Dasein’s “incompleteness”, its “not-yet” is constitutive of its Being: Dasein cannot be whole, or “together” when death finally displaces this “not-yet” because it is when “this “not-yet” has been filled… that Dasein is no longer” (Heidegger 1962, 287). Dasein, then is never simply at its end but always towards its end: “its “not-yet” belongs to it” (Heidegger 1962, 287).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidegger then writes that, “[i]n death, Dasein has not been fulfilled nor has it simply disappeared” (Heidegger 1962, 289). This is a perplexing claim. We know that death is the negation of Dasein since death is the impossibility of Dasein— but there is now a proviso attached to this: negation does not lead to Dasein disappearance. Recall that death is not just the impossibility of Dasein but rather the possibility of this impossibility. As Mark Tanzer argues in “Heidegger on death as a deficient mode”, Dasein is able to retain its ontological identity even in death since “that end is Dasein itself” (Tanzer, 27). The fact that Dasein does not disappear, nor change ontologically in death is what separates it from mere ready-to-hand or present-at-hand objects. For example, if an object loses one of its essential qualities and thereby meets its end, it loses its previous ontological identity (it disappears)  and assumes another one (Tanzer, 27). This is, of course, not the case for Dasein— Dasein, paradoxically, does not disappear in the face of its identity-loss. “Death”, writes Heidegger, “is a way to be, which Dasein takes over as soon as it is” (Heidegger 1962, 289). To say that the end belongs to Dasein, that it is a Being-towards-death, means that this impossibility— death— is structurally, that is, ontologically, inscribed in the very concept of Dasein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That death reveals itself as Dasein’s “ownmost… non-relational” possibility “which is not to be outstripped” as soon as Dasein is, can be attributed to Dasein’s thrownness (Heidegger 1962, 294). It is entirely possible that Dasein relates to its thrownness into death in a manner which is evasive, so that it can be said of Dasein that it flees from death (Heidegger 1962, 299). This fleeing, of course, does not take the form of a physical action. Dasein, in relating to its death inauthentically, occludes from its view death’s radical singularity, its unrepresentability, and the fact that death always already belongs to it. Rather, it treats death as “just a “case of death””, as though it were reconcilable with the rest of Dasein’s experience. Or perhaps Dasein broods over death, taking it seriously, announcing to himself and others that he is preparing for his death by giving alms and living righteously. This latter way of comporting oneself towards death in a pious manner is no less inauthentic than the former’s “untroubled indifference” (Heidegger 1962, 299). Merely being certain of one&amp;rsquo;s death does not suffice in relating to death authentically. For in both of these cases, Dasein does not deny the possibility of its death, indeed, it is certain of it (“[n]obody doubts that one dies”), and yet, Dasein flees from it (Heidegger 1962, 299). This cannot be said to be an authentic certainty. To be certain of death in an empirical, or apodictic manner is still to fail to relate to it authentically since death is not an object of theoretical knowledge (Heidegger 1962, 302). Indeed, such certainty is symptomatic of Dasein’s fallenness and, as such, falls short of that “primordial signification”, that is, Being-certain (Heidegger 1962, 300).  Heidegger does not treat death as an event that occurs since Dasein is not around to experience its death. Rather,  the only possible solution is an understanding of Dasein’s being-towards its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume this authentic relationship with death, Dasein must be in anticipation. This results in anxiety, which is a result of Dasein’s recognition of the non-relationality of death— a recognition that individualizes Dasein (Heidegger 1962, 308). Moreover, it is precisely anxiety that explodes the horizon of average everydayness, thereby opening up the choice for Dasein to be authentic or inauthentic. If to speak of death “existentially” is to speak of being-towards-death as a universal determination of Dasein, to speak of it “existentielly” is to speak of the specific mode that determines the nature or the character of Dasein’s relationship to death. That is, the existential is basic, while the existentiell is modificatory. Authentic being-towards-death reveals to Dasein its freedom, which is the locus of non-relationality. In this mode, the entirety of the world is understood according to Dasein’s ownmost possibility. One might, at this point, interpret authenticity as a complete negation of the they-self since to be authentic seems to imply complete autonomy and a severance from the influence of others.  However, authenticity is only a modification of the way Dasein is with others and is thus not a negation of the they-self. Recall that the they-self is an existential structure and so its negation is impossible: Dasein is the they-self. Authenticity is only a modification of this relation, one however, that Dasein can never maintain for too long. Can one, for example, remain in an authentic mode indefinitely if it is anxiety that allows for one to enter into it? Will Dasein not eventually fall back, so to speak, onto the they-self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death, one can say, then, is the principal operator of self-disclosure. The question of “how to be” is only a question that can be asked by Dasein. And, unless it is possible for a being to not be, one cannot ask what it means to be. Death, consequently, is not a defect but is rather the possibility of being authentic. Does Dasein ever take up this challenge? In other words, how does Dasein become authentic? If one searches for, in Being and Time, a propaedeutic to comporting oneself authentically, as though it were a text filled with edifying and instructional ethical propositions, then one has not even begun to understand Heidegger’s intention in writing it. For authenticity is a site of radical indeterminacy, any concrete specification of Dasein’s ownmost possibility would be to slip back into the they-self. In explicating authenticity, Heidegger is only attempting to locate this as a possibility that dasein can demand. The content of this demand, however, is never specifiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demand is produced, according to Heidegger, by the call to conscience. Just as the demand itself, the call has no determinate content. The conscience, as is usually understood, is a faculty of the soul with definitive operations; its activity is prescriptive, resulting in concrete actions. This is not how Heidegger thinks of conscience. Conscience is important to Heidegger’s project insofar as it can motivate Dasein’s authenticity. This is why Heidegger refers to the conscience as “an attestation of Dasein’s ownmost potentiality-for-Being” (Heidegger 1962, 324). And while conscience, given its relation to authenticity, appears at first to be an individual phenomenon, Heidegger surprisingly writes that “[w]hen Dasein is resolute, it can be the ‘conscience’ of Others” (Heidegger 1962, 344). A Dasein that, through resoluteness, has “chosen” its freedom by overcoming the they-self can assume a position of authority, leading others to heed the call of their conscience. It seems that, according to Heidegger, such an individual bears an enormous responsibility: the establishment of an “authentic” community. As Heidegger writes, “[o]nly by authentically Being-their-selves in resoluteness can people authentically be with one another— not by ambiguous and jealous stipulations and talkative fraternizing in the “they” and in what “they” want to undertake (Heidegger 1962, 345). But this formulation leaves the reader with various questions, which I will end with.  It would appear that the authentic community serves more as a regulative ideal— if authenticity is linked to anxiety such that an individual is never always authentic, could the same not be said of a community? Or is an authentic community established through an elimination of the they-self? In what manner is the authentic individual— supposedly the one who establishes the authentic community— to go about fulfilling his political function?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nietzsche and the Sovereign Individual</title>
      <link>/posts/deleuze/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writes Martha Nussbaum, in Hiding from Humanity, that “the fantasy of self-transcendence… is all too likely to be a fantasy of impossible strength or purity, in which crucial elements of the human are lacking” (Nussbaum, 106). She takes Nietzsche’s moral philosophy to be exemplative of this fantasy, arguing in a footnote that Nietzsche conceives of an “impossible “overman” who lacks typical weaknesses” as the end-goal of all moral striving (Nussbaum, 362). It is important here to make a terminological distinction, as I believe Nussbaum errs in referring to an individual who “lacks typical weaknesses” as the overman. Nietzsche’s construction of the overman occurs at an ontological rather than individual level. To identify the overman with the elimination of certain human weaknesses, then, is an egregious misreading, since it leads us to understand certain concepts, such as the will-to-power, as a process whereby one individual, lacking “typical weaknesses”, violently exerts physical force over another.  No doubt the concept of the will-to-power has something to do with forces, but, as mentioned above, these forces are to be understood ontologically. As Gilles Deleuze argues in Nietzsche and Philosophy, the will to power refers not “to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is to the forces in their various relationships in a proposition or a phenomenon (Deleuze, xi).  The discharge of strength that Nietzsche believes is necessary for the proper functioning of all living creatures should not be understood solely as the discharge of physical force (which, for Nietzsche, is the lowest, most base expression of the will to power) but also one that is, in its most sublime expression, creative : “Genuine philosophers… are commanders and legislators… their creating is legislating, their will to truth is— will to power (Nietzsche, 136). Thus the overman cannot be thought of simply as an invulnerable Stoic, since “he is the… product of the will to power”; he is beholden not to a brutish ethical ideal, but to a creative process of becoming (Deleuze, xii). A Nietzschean concept that would have been more appropriate to use in this context would have been that of the  “sovereign individual” (hereafter, SI), since Nietzsche seems to understand the SI as a model for self-mastery. The SI, then, can be understood at a personal, or individual level rather than an ontological one. But even if this correction were made, and we understood  the SI as representing “impossible strength or purity”, Nussbaum would yet again err in supposing that the SI is, for Nietzsche, a positive ethical ideal. In this essay, I will argue that Nietzsche does not understand the SI to be an ideal, prophet-like figure worthy of emulation. He considers the SI to be worthy of the most serious condemnation and mockery— for Nietzsche, the SI is a product, not an undoing of, the ascetic ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent scholarship has cast doubt on the idea that Nietzsche had a positive ethical ideal at all. Given his fiercely polemical style and critical deftness, with which he deconstructs various value-systems,  it might come as a surprise that Nietzsche does not offer his readers a “way forward”, so to speak, or an alternative value system. This refusal to give guidance, however, is constitutive of his philosophy as such.  When, for example, Zarathustra is asked if there is a certain way one ought to live one&amp;rsquo;s life, his response is that no such way exists. Brian Leiter argues that while Nietzsche “aims at freeing higher human beings from their false consciousness about morality”,  his philosophy is unconcerned with “a transformation of society at large” (Leiter, SEP). The concept of false consciousness here should not be taken to mean that an individual is deceived by certain social mores which can be overcome through a (philosophical or otherwise) corrective, yielding a fundamental truth. Rather, false consciousness means that the standpoint of modern consciousness is false; Nietzsche “look[s] upon the whole of consciousness primarily as “false” consciousness” (Ricoeur, 33). This is precisely why it is  impossible to speak of a Nietzschean moral philosophy, if by moral philosophy we mean a set of edifying, instructive propositions that determine how one ought to live one&amp;rsquo;s life. Nussbaum’s political liberalism, on the other hand, requires that  “certain basic rights and liberties for all citizens” are valued (Nussbaum, 62). Moreover, she identifies “primary goods”, that are, ostensibly, “prerequisites for leading a flourishing life” (Nussbaum, 62). The subject, then, for Nussbaum, is considered only in relation to the positive ethical ideals of liberalism; just institutions produce the liberal subject, and in turn, “require support from the psychology of [these] citizens” (Nussbaum, 16). The subject is conceived in an entirely different way in Nietzsche’s philosophy. Prior to an investigation of the role of the SI in the Genealogy and Nietzsche’s views on morality, one must confront the Nietzschean subject. The subject, for Nietzsche, is a multiplicity and cannot be understood independently of the will to power. (Nietzsche, 490). The subject is non-substantial, nor is it a unity. It does not possess any essential or innate characteristics in Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s ontology— he heralds the death of the subject in the same breath that he exclaims “God is dead!”. The subject is a fabrication because it is a name that is (in a manner that is not metaphysically justifiable) added on to a “profusion of competing wills to power” (Booth, 121). It cannot play any regulative role whatsoever. Such a conception of the subject calls into question the possibility of ever arriving at absolute truth. If the subject is fabricated, a mere convention that has social rather than natural origins, then the same thing can be said of the truth. Truth is nothing but a “uniformly valid and binding designation… for things” inaugurated under contingent circumstances (Nietzsche, 354) Both the subject and the truth are then, for Nietzsche, impermanent. The Nietzschean riposte to Nussbaum’s argument that the precepts of liberalism, even if not universally true or valid, can be argued to be superior to various other socio-political arrangements (such as communitarianism) through an impartial investigative procedure, would be that this procedure would be carried out not by a rational agent, but by a “self-deceiving subject” that assumes the truth of what it is attempting to demonstrate as true. As David Booth argues in “Nietzsche on the “Subject as Multiplicity”, the subject “is able to fabricate religious ideals and “other worlds” … without necessarily having any consciousness of its authorship of those ideals or words”,  and instead posits them as universal truths awaiting discovery (Booth, 121). In the second treatise of the Genealogy, Nietzsche argues that such an investigative procedure, far from being impartial, is one that is essentially “ascetic”, whereby “few ideas are to be made indelible, omnipresent, unforgettable, “fixed”&amp;hellip; and the ascetic procedures… are means for taking these ideas out of competition with all other ideas” (Nietzsche, 38).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the treatise, Nietzsche refers to the SI as the “ripest fruit” of a certain process— but what is this process? It might seem at first as a critical break from the morality of custom; Nietzsche’s discussion of the SI seems almost laudatory, devoid of his usual cynicism. The SI, however, is the “ripest fruit” on a tree whose roots are poisonous (Nietzsche, 37). When discussing the SI, Nietzsche’s tone is not laudatory, but rather bitterly ironic and derisive. The SI emerges from a process which has made man calculable, in fact it is the “great justification” of the morality of custom (Nietzsche, 36). But despite Nietzsche placing the SI at the end of this monstrous, “prehistoric” process, does his discussion of the matter not seemingly take an abrupt turn in the pages that follow (Nietzsche, 36)? Is the SI not constituted through a negation of the morality of custom, embodying a higher, more perfect ideal, possessing his “own independent long will”; the SI, writes Nietzsche is an  “autonomous and supermoral” agent, “resembling only himself” (we know already that Nietzsche does not allow for a self-identical subject) (Nietzsche, 36). One could say that the morality of custom is the SI’s constitutive negation; the SI cannot be conceived of as truly “free… from the morality of custom” since even to negate, or overcome, the morality of custom is, in some sense, to be tied to it.  Recall Nietzsche’s views on false consciousness: it is the greatest folly to think that one can pierce this veil in order to apprehend “reality”. That is, if Nietzsche truly praised the SI, it would mean that he viewed false consciousness as a state of affairs to be remedied or improved upon, which, as I have argued above, is not the case.  But this is what modern man—the SI—strives towards, and it is precisely for this reason that he is an object of scorn for Nietzsche.
That the SI is indelibly marked by the morality of custom becomes especially evident when one considers the relationship between memory and promise-making that Nietzsche details in the second treatise. The SI is that individual who is “permitted to promise”, but this ability to make promises does not signal a break from humanity qua herd but actually constitutes it: “one has given one’s promise in order to live within the advantages of society, — and truly!&amp;hellip; one finally came “to reason”&amp;hellip; how much blood and horror there is at the base of all “good things”!” (Nietzsche, 36). If one were up to this point unconvinced that Nietzsche, in referring to the SI as “autonomous and supermoral”, does so in an entirely ironic manner, this passage makes it clear that he could not have meant it otherwise. For even the most hallowed faculty of man— reason— is here subject to ridicule. The SI’s “mastery over… affects”, awe-inspiring “seriousness”, is founded on “blood and horror” (Nietzsche, 38, 39).  Nietzsche is explicit on this point— all of these “good things” and qualities are in fact the culmination of, and thus belong in their entirety to “asceticism” (Nietzsche, 38, 39). If Nietzsche distinguishes between the SI and the herd, it is only to the extent that the SI remains within the herd, unlike its other members, without the threat of external punishment— “it has [thoroughly] internalized the process” (Rukgaber, 216). The SI is thus an individual who self-flagellates; he becomes his own executioner. He may very well avoid the slave morality that characterizes the herd, but he does so only superficially, since the instinct the SI internalizes— what he calls his “conscience”— is slave morality under a different name. This conscience, far from being something naturally present in man, surfaces at the same time as “contract law”, the debtor-creditor relationship, and such concepts as “guilt… duty… sacred duty” (Rukgaber, 230; Nietzsche, 41). The SI can indeed be said to be a superior being, with a major caveat: he is superior only to those weaker, less able beings in the herd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reading can be contested on two counts. One may argue that the SI is Nietzsche’s positive ethical ideal simply because of his affirmative power— the SI is capable of saying “yes” to himself (he is a responsible being) and this puts him outside the herd. Secondly, one could object to the evolutionary picture provided by arguing that the SI represents a “unique form of agency” that develops “out of animality”, and is for this reason fully “outside” the herd (Rukgaber, 217). I will invoke Deleuze to respond to the first objection. He writes in Nietzsche and Philosophy that “[t]o affirm is not to take responsibility for, to take on the burden of what is, but to release, to set free what lives” (Deleuze, 185). As mentioned before, according to Deleuze, true affirmation must be exhaustively creative; a certain kind of inventiveness that is absent in merely “taking responsibility”. We cannot oppose the SI to the self-denying, weak-willed ascetic since the SI’s “yes” is not affirmative in the sense that Nietzsche wants us to think about affirmation. According to Deleuze, the SI’s affirmative power is similar to that of an ass— “the ass is the animal that says “Ye-a”, the affirmative and affirming animal” (Deleuze, 170). The SI, like the ass, affirms only the negative; it does not say yes to affirmation itself but only the “nihilistic reality of the ‘no’” (de Zeeuw, 7). What is in fact an impulse hostile to life deceivingly presents itself as affirmative.  There is a basic interpretative error that the second objection relies on. It assumes that Nietzsche is offering the reader an account of the evolution of the human from animality, or human agency out of animal-like instinct. But the SI evolves out of “already human capacities” that function as the ground for its conscience (Rukgaber, 217). Take for example what Nietzsche writes about forgetfulness in the second treatise: “[a]nd precisely this necessarily forgetful animal, in whom forgetting is a strength… has bred for himself a counter-device, memory, with the help of which forgetfulness can be suspended in certain cases” (Nietzsche, 36). One should not be fooled by the word “animal” here, since Nietzsche is referring to human beings at a certain stage of their development; the ability to suspend forgetfulness is, of course, preceded by forgetfulness, which is still a “uniquely human [capacity]” (Rukgaber, 217). While this development concerns the coming to birth of ethical agency, it does not emerge out of “mere animality” — the question that Nietzsche asks is not how consciousness develops in the animal mind but how the subject comes to be what it is, or, as Richard Schacht argues, how human beings develop a (modern) personal identity (Rukgaber, 219). The second part of this objection concerns the SI’s self-imposed exile from the herd. While I have argued above that the SI cannot be outside the herd, it is also important to note that, if one could attribute to Nietzsche a positive ethical ideal, he would never conceive of it along the lines of an autonomous agent completely detached from mundane, worldly affairs. If a Nietzschean ethical ideal could be described in any meaningful sense, it would be exemplified not by a being who transcends the world but one who immerses himself in it, “[burying] himself within nature” in a redemptive manner (Rukgaber, 229).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that Nietzsche is a masterful ironist, writing with a doubleness of tone that is purposefully confounding and misleading. Yet this should not be mistaken for a philosophical error since it is a question of style, which is part and parcel of his philosophy. If one were to attempt to “see through” Nietzsche’s various idiosyncrasies, in order to distill his thought, arrive at its “essence”, one would find that no such thing exists. He uplifts in the same breath that he debases; he offers “not one Truth but many experiences and many truths” (Ansell-Pearson, 314). Hence we should not be surprised that Nietzsche is able to maintain two seemingly contradictory positions, as appears to be the case with the SI (though I think I have demonstrated in this essay that Nietzsche only apparently praises the SI and harbors for this product of asceticism the deepest loathing).&lt;/p&gt;
