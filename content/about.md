Hi! Welcome to my blog. What you'll find here are some scattered-- at times incoherent-- thoughts, and essays on certain topics that interest me. I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Toronto studying Literature, Critical Theory, and Religion. 

My research interests include psychoanalysis, French cultural theory, The Frankfurt School, German Idealism, and Marxist theory.
